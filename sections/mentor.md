[PHP Mentoring](http://phpmentoring.org/)

 * We are a formal, personal, long term, peer to peer mentorship organization focused on creating networks of skilled developers from all walks of life. We are PHP developers first and foremost but that is not all we do, nor is it the only skill we intend to pass on to others. We are mentors and apprentices, teachers and students, coaches, counselers and friends. We're not in this for profit but for the end result, a strong community of talented developers doing some fabulous work. We give back to the community as much as we take, we build up not tear down, and above all we believe in "play nice" and "code well".
