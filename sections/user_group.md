[Nomad PHP](https://nomadphp.com/)

 * Nomad PHP is a virtual user group. We gather monthly on-line to learn about development from speakers all over the world. We meet using a webinar service which allows our speakers to share slides while they speak. We also have an open IRC channel (irc.freenode.net / #nomadphp) during meetings which allows attendees to be a part of the discussion as well as ask questions of the speaker.In addition to the live meeting, we supply all attendees with access to a video recording of the meeting. This allows those who arenâ€™t available at meeting time to still have the opportunity to learn. Also those who attended the live meeting can get a refresher course by viewing the video later.
