[atoum](https://github.com/atoum/atoum)

 * A simple, modern and intuitive unit testing framework for PHP! Just like SimpleTest or PHPUnit, atoum is a unit testing framework specific to the PHP language. However, it has been designed from the start with the following ideas in mind: Can be implemented rapidly. Simplify test development. Allow for writing reliable, readable, and clear unit tests. To accomplish that, it massively uses capabilities provided by PHP 5.3, to give the developer a whole new way of writing unit tests.

[Codeception](http://codeception.com/)

 * Codeception PHP Testing Framework is designed to work just out of the box.

[Mockery](https://github.com/padraic/mockery)

 * Mockery is a simple yet flexible PHP mock object framework for use in unit testing with PHPUnit, PHPSpec or any other testing framework. Its core goal is to offer a test double framework with a succinct API capable of clearly defining all possible object operations and interactions using a human readable Domain Specific Language (DSL). Designed as a drop in alternative to PHPUnit's phpunit-mock-objects library, Mockery is easy to integrate with PHPUnit and can operate alongside phpunit-mock-objects without the World ending.

[Phake](https://github.com/mlively/Phake)

 * Phake is a framework for PHP that aims to provide mock objects, test doubles and method stubs. Phake was inspired by a lack of flexibility and ease of use in the current mocking frameworks combined with a recent experience with Mockito for Java. A key conceptual difference in mocking between Phake and most of php mocking frameworks (ie: mock functionality in PHPUnit, PHPMock, and mock functionality in SimpleTest) is that Phake (like Mockito) employs a verification strategy to ensure that calls get made. That is to say, you call your code as normal and then after you have finished the code being tested you can verify whether or not expected methods were called. This is very different from the aforementioned products for php which use an expectation strategy where you lay out your expectations prior to any calls being made.

[PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/)

 * PHPUnit is a programmer-oriented testing framework for PHP. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks.

[Phrophecy](https://github.com/phpspec/prophecy)

 * Prophecy is a highly opinionated yet very powerful and flexible PHP object mocking framework. Though initially it was created to fulfil phpspec2 needs, it is flexible enough to be used inside any testing framework out there with minimal effort.

[SimpleTest](http://simpletest.org/)

 * It is a PHP unit test and web test framework. Users of JUnit will be familiar with most of the interface.
