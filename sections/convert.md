# Convert #

This section covers both converters and parsers.

[Ansi to HTML5](https://github.com/sensiolabs/ansi-to-html)

 * This small library only does one thing: converting a text containing ANSI codes to an HTML5 fragment.

[ByteUnits](https://github.com/gabrielelana/byte-units)

 * This is a utility component for parsing, formatting, converting and manipulating byte units in various formats.

[Ciconia](https://github.com/kzykhys/Ciconia)

 * A Markdown parser with support for Githubs flavoured Markdown.

[commonmark](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark)

 * league/commonmark is a Markdown parser for PHP which supports the full CommonMark spec. It is based on the CommonMark JS reference implementation by John MacFarlane.

[Decoda](https://github.com/milesj/decoda)

 * A lightweight lexical string parser for BBCode styled markup.

[HTML5-PHP](https://github.com/Masterminds/html5-php)

 * The need for an HTML5 parser in PHP is clear. This project initially began with the seemingly abandoned html5lib project original source. But after some initial refactoring work, we began a new parser.

[Markdown](https://github.com/cebe/markdown)

 * A set of PHP classes, each representing a Markdown flavor, and a command line tool for converting markdown files to HTML files. The implementation focus is to be fast (see benchmark) and extensible. Parsing Markdown to HTML is as simple as calling a single method (see Usage) providing a solid implementation that gives most expected results even in non-trivial edge cases.

[Parsedown](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown)

 * Simple Markdown Parser in PHP.

[PHP Conversion](https://github.com/Crisu83/php-conversion)

 * Library for converting units and sizes in PHP. Units supported: Acceleration, angle, area, digital information, electric current, frequency, fuel consumption, length, luminous intensity, mass, power, pressure, speed, temperature, time, velocity, voltage and volume. 

[php-markdown](https://github.com/michelf/php-markdown)

 * This is a library package that includes the PHP Markdown parser and its sibling PHP Markdown Extra with additional features. Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

[PHPPdf](https://github.com/psliwa/PHPPdf)

 * PHPPdf is library that transforms an XML document to a PDF document or graphics files. The XML source document is similar to HTML, but there are lots of differences in names and properties of attributes, properties of tags, and there are a lot of not standard tags, not all tags from html are supported, stylesheet is described in an xml document, not in css.

[PHP Units of Measure](https://github.com/triplepoint/php-units-of-measure)

 * This is a PHP library for representing and converting physical units of measure. The utility of this library is in encapsulating physical quantities in such a way that you don't have to keep track of which unit they're represented in.

[Snappy](https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy)

 * Snappy is a PHP5 library allowing thumbnail, snapshot or PDF generation from a url or a html page. It uses the excellent webkit-based wkhtmltopdf and wkhtmltoimage available on OSX, linux, windows. You will have to download wkhtmltopdf 0.12.x in order to use Snappy. Please, check FAQ before opening a new issue. Snappy is a tiny wrapper around wkhtmltox, so lots of issues are already answered, resolved or wkhtmltox ones.
