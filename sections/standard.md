# Standard #

Please note that there is no canonical way to use PHP and there is not supposed to be one. PHP is a general purpose scripting language with support for imperative, functional, object-oriented, procedural, and reflective paradigms. You - as the programmer - are free to choose the paradigm and style of coding you prefer.

[PHP-FIG](http://php-fig.com/)

 * PHP-FIG is not an official standard. After php|tek 2009, a number of PHP Frameworks developers launched a new initiative: PHP-FIG, the PHP Frameworks Interoperability Group. The idea is to  have projects representative members in the PHPFIG talk about the commonalities between different projects and find ways to collaborate all together. From the website: "_Our main audience is each other, but we’re very aware that the rest of the PHP community is watching. If other folks want to adopt what we’re doing they are welcome to do so, but that is not the aim. Nobody in the group wants to tell you, as a programmer, how to build your application._"

[PHP The Right Way](http://www.phptherightway.com/)

 * This website aims to introduce new PHP developers to some topics which they may not discover until it is too late, and aims to give seasoned pros some fresh ideas on those topics they’ve been doing for years without ever reconsidering. This website will also not tell you which tools to use, but instead offer suggestions for multiple options, when possible explaining the differences in approach and use-case. PHP: The Right Way is an easy-to-read, quick reference for PHP popular coding standards, links to authoritative tutorials around the Web and what the contributors consider to be best practices at the present time.
