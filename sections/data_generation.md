# Data generation #

[Alice](https://github.com/nelmio/alice)

 * Relying on fzaninotto/Faker, Alice allows you to create a ton of fixtures/fake data for use while developing or testing your project. It gives you a few essential tools to make it very easy to generate complex data with constraints in a readable and easy to edit way, so that everyone on your team can tweak the fixtures if needed.

[Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker)

 * Faker is a PHP library that generates fake data for you. Whether you need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents, fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from a production service, Faker is for you. Faker is heavily inspired by Perl's Data::Faker, and by ruby's Faker.
