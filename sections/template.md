[Dwoo](http://dwoo.org/)

 * Dwoo is a PHP5 Template Engine that was started in early 2008. The idea came from the fact that Smarty, a well known template engine, is getting older and older. It carries the weight of it's age, having old features that are inconsistent compared to newer ones, being written for PHP4 its Object Oriented aspect doesn't take advantage of PHP5's more advanced features in the area, etc. Hence Dwoo was born, hoping to provide a more up to date and stronger engine. So far it has proven to be faster than Smarty in many areas, and it provides a compatibility layer to allow developers that have been using Smarty for years to switch their application over to Dwoo progressively.

[PHPTAL](http://phptal.org/)

 * PHPTAL is a PHP implementation of ZPT work. To be short, PHPTAL is a XML/XHTML template library for PHP. While most web developpers continue to use ASP/JSP/PHP tags as the core language of their templates, the Zope community came with a refreshing idea named TAL. The idea was to move presentation actions inside XHTML attributes instead of using plain tags or elements.

[Plates](http://platesphp.com/)

 * Plates is a native PHP template system that’s fast, easy to use and easy to extend. It’s inspired by the excellent Twig template engine and strives to bring modern template language functionality to native PHP templates. Plates is designed for developers who prefer to use native PHP templates over compiled template languages, such as Twig or Smarty.

[Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/)

 * Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. This implies that PHP code is application logic, and is separated from the presentation.

[Template Blocks](http://templateblocks.com/)

 * Template Blocks is a visual template engine, replacing any semantics of previous generation engines with an AJAX interface. It's written in PHP and is distributed under the GPL.

[TinyButStrong](http://www.tinybutstrong.com/)

 * TinyButStrong is a library that enables you to dynamically create XML/HTML pages and any other files based on text source. It's a Template Engine for the PHP language. It enables you to easily display information from your database, but also to seriously harmonize and simplify your PHP programming.

[Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/)

 * Twig is a modern template engine for PHP. Twig compiles templates down to plain optimized PHP code. The overhead compared to regular PHP code was reduced to the very minimum. Twig has a sandbox mode to evaluate untrusted template code. This allows Twig to be used as a template language for applications where users may modify the template design. Twig is powered by a flexible lexer and parser. This allows the developer to define its own custom tags and filters, and create its own DSL.
