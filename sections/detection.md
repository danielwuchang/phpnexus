# Detection #

[DeviceDetector](https://github.com/piwik/device-detector)

 * The Universal Device Detection library, that parses User Agents and detects devices (desktop, tablet, mobile, tv, cars, console, etc.), and detects clients (browsers, feed readers, media players, PIMs, ...), operating systems, devices, brands and models.

[Mobile-Detect](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect)

 * Mobile_Detect is a lightweight PHP class for detecting mobile devices (including tablets). It uses the User-Agent string combined with specific HTTP headers to detect the mobile environment. We're committed to make Mobile_Detect the best open-source mobile detection resource and this is why before each release we're running unit tests, we also research and update the detection rules on daily and weekly basis.
