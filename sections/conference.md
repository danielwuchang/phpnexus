[The PHP UK Conference](http://phpconference.co.uk/)

 * PHP UK Conference was started in 2006 with the aim to offer the local PHP community access to industry updates and professional development at an affordable rate. Costs are minimised to keep ticket prices as low as possible, and any surplus funds are used to fund community events throughout the year and to fund the following year's conference.
